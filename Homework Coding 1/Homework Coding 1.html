    <h2 id="vital-role">Vital Role of Sleep</h2>
    <p>
        Sleep plays a <b>crucial role</b> in maintaining overall health and well-being. During this restorative period, the body engages in essential processes such as <i>tissue repair, muscle growth, and immune system strengthening.</i>
        Moreover, sleep is vital for <i>cognitive functions</i>; it allows the brain to consolidate memories and process information gathered throughout the day. A good night’s sleep enhances <i>focus, creativity, and problem-solving skills,</i> enabling individuals to perform at their best.
        Prioritizing quality sleep is <b>essential</b> for physical and mental vitality, making it a <b>cornerstone</b> of a healthy lifestyle.

    <h2 id="consequences">Consequences of Sleep Deprivation</h2>
    <p>
        Sleep deprivation can have significant and far-reaching consequences on both <i>physical and mental health.</i> Individuals who consistently lack adequate sleep may experience heightened irritability, reduced concentration, and impaired decision-making abilities. In the long term, <b>chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to serious health issues</b>, <i>including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and weakened immune function.</i>
        Additionally, insufficient sleep can contribute to <b>mental health problems</b> such as <i>anxiety and depression, exacerbating feelings of stress and emotional instability.</i> Overall, neglecting sleep can severely impact daily functioning and quality of life.
